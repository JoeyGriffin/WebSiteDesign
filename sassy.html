	<p id="ParaOne"> Harper Steele and Anna Kenan founded Sassy Signs Greenville in August 2020.  We are 2 good friends and neighbors who saw a need during the pandemic since people weren’t able to gather in groups but still wanted birthdays and celebrations to be special and recognized.  We wanted ours to be different from the other yard sign companies! <br> Harper is the wife of David and they have 2 daughters, one at Clemson and one at USC.  Harper is a caregiver and has her own decorating business.   Anna is the wife of Kemper and has 1 son who is at USC and a daughter at Eastside High School.  She is a substitute preschool teacher and stay at home mom.

	<p id="ParaTwo"> We hand make each sign from scratch!  We purchase 4’x8’ sheets of plywood.  We find what graphic we want to make, project it on the wood, trace it out and cut it with a jigsaw.  We then sand and paint the sign and add our personal, decorative touches to each one. <br>Our signs are $65 for the first sign and $10 each additional sign.  This price included personalization and delivery within a 15 mile radius of I85/385 in Greenville, SC. If it is outside that delivery area, there is an additional charge of $1 per mile for setup and pickup.  These signs stay up for approximately 48 hours.  For our baby announcement signs, they are $85 and that includes a medallion for them to keep personalized with the birth information.  These stay up for 5 days.
