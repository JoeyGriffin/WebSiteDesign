	<p id="ParaOne"> Sassy Signs is here for all of your celebratory yard sign needs. From birthdays to anniversaries, Sassy Signs has a wide range of signs and themes to choose from. After you order, we will come the night before your celebration and set up the signs along with some lights, and be out before you can even see us. Everything is done discreetly so you can have your perfect surprise!

	<p id="ParaTwo"> Harper Steele and Anna Kenan founded Sassy Signs Greenville in August 2020.  We are 2 good friends and neighbors who saw a need during the pandemic since people werenâ€™t able to gather in groups but still wanted birthdays and celebrations to be special and recognized.  We wanted ours to be different from the other yard sign companies!
